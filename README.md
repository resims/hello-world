# hello-world

My name is Ryan Sims. I am a second year junior at Ball state pursuing a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Computer Tech.
I am an Eagle Scout and am still completing my training to be Assistant Scoutmaster of my troop.
I am from Brownsburg, IN which is located on I-74, west of Indy. I graduated from Brownsburg High School in 2017, and was very involved in band.
I currently volunteer my time with Cardinal Catholic by planning our Thursday-night-after-mass gatherings, helping with the youth retreats that we put on throughout the year.
I also volunteer at the Connection Corner Library in the Whitely-Morningside with their Digital Climbers Program, which teaches kids basic programming concepts through games.
